- **backend/**: Node.js/Express API, PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM, business logic, validation, and database seed scripts.
- **frontend/**: React (Vite) single-page application, modular components, layouts, and pages for dashboard, campaigns, and subscribers.

This structure supports clear separation of concerns and scalability for future development.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
    ```
    PORT=3001
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_NAME=pulse_db
    DB_USER=postgres
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```

3. Run database migrations and seed initial data:
    ```sh
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    node seed.js
    ```

4. Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

---

## Database Seeding

To ensure the dashboard displays meaningful data immediately, the backend includes a script to populate the database with dummy subscribers, sample campaigns, and analytics events.

**How to run:**
```sh
node backend/seed.js
```
This allows for instant testing of analytics, pagination, and filtering features.

---

## Dashboard Preview

_Add a screenshot or GIF of the working dashboard here (e.g., analytics cards, campaign editor, subscriber list with pagination)._

Recommended views to capture:
- Dashboard with analytics cards and chart
- Campaign editor with live preview
- Campaign list (draft/sent)
- Subscriber list with pagination

---

## Technical Trade-off Report

**Trade-off:**  
Server-side pagination and filtering for subscribers and campaigns (using limit/offset) instead of client-side.

**Reasoning:**  
This approach is more scalable as data grows, avoids unnecessary memory usage on the client, and reflects real-world production systems.

**Trade-off:**  
Slightly increased backend complexity, but significantly better performance and scalability.

## Tech Stack

| Layer     | Technology                |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Frontend  | React, Vite, Tailwind CSS|
| Backend   | Node.js, Express         |
| Database  | PostgreSQL               |
| ORM       | Sequelize                |
| Charts    | Recharts                 |
| Validation| Zod                 |

---

## Architecture Decisions

- **Service Layer Pattern:**  
  Controllers are kept thin; business logic and Sequelize queries are handled in services for maintainability and testability.

- **Relational Modeling:**  
  Campaigns, Subscribers, and Analytics are modeled with proper associations to reflect real SaaS workflows.

- **Draft-First Campaign Flow:**  
  Campaigns can be edited multiple times before sending, matching real marketing tools.

- **Error Handling and Validation:**  
  Global error handling middleware and schema validation (Zod) ensure robust API behavior.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  The project is organized into clear modules (controllers, services, models, routes, validators) to support scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Final Notes

- The repository maintains a clean, step-by-step commit history, reflecting intentional development.
- The MVP demonstrates full-stack product thinking, ORM-based relational modeling, and production-ready frontend patterns.
- The architecture and codebase are designed for extensibility, making it easy to add new features or scale up for real-world use.
